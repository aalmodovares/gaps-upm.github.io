## Machine Learning for communications

We have open positions for TFM/TFG students. If you are interested in any of these lines, do not hesitate to contact us!

### Meta-learning in non-stationary environments

Fast adaptation is key in non-stationary environments in communication settings. We aim to explore the use of Meta-learning techniques to this end, and evaluate the performance compared to state-of-the-art methods used nowadays.
