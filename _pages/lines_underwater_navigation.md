### Underwater navigation in non-stationary environments

The underwater environment is challenging for autonomous navigation due to the strong attenuation of the radio signal, that prevents the use of GPS in vessels that navigate underwater. Moreover, the underwater medium is challenging due to the presence of currents, swirls, and other kind of disturbances. In this line, we aim to develop methods that can be used in this challenging conditions for navigation.
